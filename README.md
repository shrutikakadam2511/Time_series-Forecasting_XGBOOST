# Time_series-Forecasting_XGBOOST
Time series forecasting with XGBoost converts time data into a supervised format using lag features and optional date-time stats. The model predicts future values based on past patterns. It handles non-linear trends well but requires careful feature engineering, as it doesnâ€™t natively model time dependencies.
